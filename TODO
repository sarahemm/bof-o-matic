- Add phone number field to schedulers and send notifications to them too
- Display the self-scheduling token on the proposal view for schedulers
- Add a link to the self-scheduling email to avoid need to type in a token
- Signal bom-maild and bom-smsd to do runs immediately once something is queued, to speed up queue running without constant polling


BUGS
- PDF generation fails if non-ASCII characters are involved, due to needing
  external fonts.


"nice to haves"
