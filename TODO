- Email features to add:
-- Calendar link in BoF emails

- Kiosk mode timeout currently gets ignored if the current page is the one we redirect to, but the logic when on the redirect destination page should actually be:
--- Enable the timeout if the page becomes "dirty" in any way
--- Reset the timeout whenever the user types or mouses

- Implement proper timezone support (there's probably stuff that assumes it's
  in +0000 since that's where the current server is)

BUGS
- Scheduled sessions with no interest don't show on the grid (unlikely to
  happen, but still a bug)

"nice to haves"
- Scheduler user management screen (instead of having to use sqlite3 CLI)
