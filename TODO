TODO for bof-o-matic 2026
- Refactor things to be overall Ruby-er, now that there's breathing time
- Use jQuery and Bootstrap gems rather than having to manually pull those in
- API so other interfaces could be added (CLI, bof-o-matic/X, gopher, packet radio BBS, fax-back, SSTV, etc.)
- Ability to block off specific time slots (meals, plenary sessions, etc.) from scheduling
- More mobile-friendly layout
- Ability for schedulers to merge BoFs if two people submit essentially the same things
- Figure out a way to display the entire list of proposals near the BoF wall
- Consider an interstitial "other BoFs look like what you're proposing, are you sure you want to propose this one?" or something, to reduce duplicates


BUGS
- PDF generation fails if non-ASCII characters are involved, due to needing
  external fonts.
- PNG generation fails if non-ASCII characters are involved (they are shown as blank)
