- Implement proper timezone support (there's probably stuff that assumes it's
  in +0000 since that's where the current server is)

- Test unicode support throughout emails and web UI

- Grid view that has all times on the X axis and rooms on the Y

BUGS
- Scheduled sessions with no interest don't show on the grid (unlikely to
  happen, but still a bug)

"nice to haves"
- Scheduler user management screen (instead of having to use sqlite3 CLI)
