- Finish basic email notification subsystem

- Email features to add:
-- Email schedulers when a BoF hits a certain threshold of inteerst
-- Reminder emails x minutes before a BoF
-- Calendar link in BoF emails

- Scheduler notes should be displayed somewhere, right now they're ignored
- Timeout and return to main page after some time (for "kiosk" type use)
- Un-scheduling a scheduled BoF
