- Email features to add:
-- Calendar link in BoF emails

- Display a countdown for the kiosk mode timer, as right now it's non-obvious
  that you're about to be kicked out

- Implement proper timezone support (there's probably stuff that assumes it's
  in +0000 since that's where the current server is)

BUGS
- Scheduled sessions with no interest don't show on the grid (unlikely to
  happen, but still a bug)

"nice to haves"
- Scheduler user management screen (instead of having to use sqlite3 CLI)
