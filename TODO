- Email features to add:
-- Calendar link in BoF emails

- Scheduler notes should be displayed somewhere, right now they're ignored
- Timeout and return to main page after some time (for "kiosk" type use)

BUGS
- Scheduled sessions with no interest don't show on the grid (unlikely to
  happen, but still a bug)

"nice to haves"
- Scheduler user management screen (instead of having to use sqlite3 CLI)
